# Escape

*Escape* is a 2D game developed following the book *Mission Python*
by Sean McManus ([www.sean.co.uk](www.sean.co.uk)).

## Dependencies
The game uses the Pygame Zero librairy ([https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)).  
To run it, you should install Pygame Zero, then simply enter the game directory and run `pgzrun escape.py`.  

### Note
Depending on your OS, `pgzrun` may not work. This is the reason an additional import is made (`import pgzrun`), with an extra `pgzrun.go()` command at the very end of the game file. Hence you would like to run the game by using `python3 escape.py` instead of `pgzrun escape.py`.
